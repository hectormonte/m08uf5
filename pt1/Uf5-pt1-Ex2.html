	<h1>Space Exploration</h1>
	<p><b>Space exploration</b> is the use of <strong>astronomy</strong> and space technology to explore outer space. While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, <small>like its classical form astronomy</small>, is one of the main sources for space science.</p><br>
	<p>While the observation of objects in space, <mark>known as astronomy</mark>, <em>predates reliable recorded history</em>, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the <sub>mid-twentieth century</sub> that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common <del>rationales</del> for exploring space include <ins>advancing scientific research</ins>, national prestige, <i>uniting different nations</i>, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and <sup>developing military and strategic advantages</sup> against other countries.</p>
